Stephanie Hong, MS, FAMIA
Stephanie Hong serves as the Director of Translational Informatics Applications at the General Internal Medicine and Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Section of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

She earned her BS in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and recently completed her MS in Applied Health Sciences Informatics at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Stephanie was a pivotal member of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Data Ingestions and Harmonization team. Her work with N3C, the largest centralized repository of COVID-related patient Electronic Health Record (EHR) data in the United States, has provided researchers with access to harmonized COVID-19 data in the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) format. In recognition of her contributions to biomedical informatics, she was named a Fellow of the American Medical Informatics Association (FAMIA) in 2022.

Currently, Stephanie focuses on integrating multi-modal patient data using Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) technology. This work involves creating a comprehensive view of the patient healthcare journey by linking data from EHRs, claims, medical images, voice recordings, and health monitoring devices.

She is also deeply invested in the growing adoption of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) in biomedical informatics and healthcare IT. Stephanie is a strong advocate for the transformative power of FHIR in shaping the future of healthcare. She recognizes leveraging FHIR is essential for advancing the field and is actively driving efforts to unlock its full potential. Understanding that successful adoption requires seamless collaboration, Stephanie champions strategic partnerships among healthcare providers, IT developers, regulators, and standards organizations to overcome challenges and maximize FHIR's impact. Her dedication reflects a forward-thinking commitment to advancing healthcare interoperability and innovation.

Stephanie is honored and excited to serve as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for JHU SOM BIDS FHIR (ME.250.778.0000.SP25) course. Her multidisciplinary expertise and hands-on experience with cutting-edge informatics projects highlight her dedication to advancing the field and supporting students in their learning journey.
